# iCalendar POC - Backend (NestJS, Postgres, Prisma & Docker)

This repository presents the backend component of the iCalendar Proof of Concept (POC). It is built using **NestJS**, **Postgres**, **Prisma**, and is fully containerized with **Docker** for both the database and application runtime. Additionally, GitHub Actions have been integrated to streamline the deployment process to a DigitalOcean VPS.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Management:**  
  Implements secure user registration, login, and session handling.

- **Appointment Scheduling API:**  
  Offers endpoints for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting user appointments.

- **Integration with React Frontend:**  
  Designed to work seamlessly with the React-based frontend POC, providing a reliable and efficient data layer.

- **Database Management with Prisma & Postgres:**  
  Utilizes Prisma as the ORM layer, ensuring a type-safe interface to a Postgres database. Migrations and schema changes are handled effortlessly.

- **Dockerized Deployment:**  
  Both the backend application and the Postgres database run in Docker containers, simplifying setup and deployment across different environments.

- **GitHub Actions & DigitalOcean VPS Deployment:**  
  Continuous integration and deployment workflows automatically build and deploy the backend application to a DigitalOcean VPS, ensuring a smooth and reliable production environment.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS (vX)**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **Postgres**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **Prisma**: A modern ORM that provides type-safe database access, migrations, and an intuitive schema management.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerizing the backend and database, making the setup and scaling of services more manageable.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to a DigitalOcean VPS.

## Deployment & CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions:**  
  The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys the Docker image to the DigitalOcean VPS environment whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

- **DigitalOcean VPS Setup:**  
  You will need to configure your DigitalOcean VPS, ensuring that Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Update the GitHub Actions workflow with the correct credentials and server information to enable automatic deployments.

## Next Steps & Improvements

- **Advanced Security & Logging:**  
  Implement more robust error handling, logging, and security measures (e.g., rate-limiting, improved JWT strategies).

- **Scalability & Load Testing:**  
  Explore horizontal scaling options using Docker swarm or Kubernetes and consider load testing in the future to ensure the backend can handle increased traffic.

- **More Sophisticated Scheduling Logic:**  
  Enhance the appointment scheduling logic (e.g., recurring appointments, reminders, and calendar integrations).
